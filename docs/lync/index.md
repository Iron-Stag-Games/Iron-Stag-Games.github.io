# What is Lync?

Lync is a file sync tool for Roblox created to meet the needs of the community and to improve maintainability over similar tools.

## Why Lync?

### Version Control

Roblox version control is opaque and often unreliable. With [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the industry standard in version control, you can precisely track changes made to your project.

Integrate with version control services like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and many more to enable collaborative editing.

### External Text Editors

The Roblox Studio editor is slow and has a limited feature set. Lync allows you to edit files on your OS using your preferred text editor or IDE.

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended)

VS Code in particular has a wide array of extensions available for use with Lync.

### Cross Compilation

If Luau isn't your flavor, you may choose to use a different programming language by using a cross compiler.
